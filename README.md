## My process

I started the project by studying the task and planning each step. First I made the main rectangle, rounded the edges. Then I added the image, put a fixed height on it, to get a proportional width. Then I proceeded to add h3, h1 and paragraph texts, prices and finally a button. As a final touch, I created a hover and active effect. Unfortunately, responsive layout design isn't my strong side at the moment, so I'll have to commit to it 101% after this project.

### Built with

- Semantic HTML5 markup
- CSS custom properties
- Visual Studio Code

### What I learned

This was an excellent practice project. I learned to be consistent and when I struggle, internet has all answers.
